# RSNA-Degenerative-Lumbar-Spine-Image-Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the research project titled "Comparative Model Evaluation of Lightweight Transformer-Based and CNN-Based Architectures for Degenerative Lumbar Spine Classification."

## Research Motivation
Low back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide, significantly affecting the quality of life and imposing a substantial economic burden. Accurate and efficient classification of degenerative lumbar spine conditions is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment. This research aims to address this need by identifying the optimal model for diagnosing these conditions.

## Research Objectives
- Evaluate and compare the performance of CNN-based models such as VGG, EfficientNet, and EfficientNetV2 against lightweight transformer-based models, specifically Vision Transformers (ViTs).
- Classify lumbar spine conditions into three categories: normal, moderate, and severe.
- Provide insights into the strengths and limitations of CNNs and transformers for medical image classification to guide the selection of an effective tool for spine diagnostics based on accuracy and efficiency.
